# RG35xxPs

Powershell installer/updated for custom [Batocera firmware](https://github.com/rg35xx-cfw) on the [Anbernic RG35xx][rg35xx] handheld game system.

Only tested on Windows, YMMV.

## Instructions

## Limitations

### Resizing Partitions

Right now re/sizing FAT32 volumes (i.e. the ROMS partition) on Windows for > 32GB isn't doable without third party tools.
I haven't been able to find a reliable CLI tool to do this, but please open an enhancement request if you know of one.

In the mean time, you can add a üëçüèª to the [request][balena-request] to include this capability
as a feature in balena-cli so that large SD cards could be auto-formatted and loaded with ROMs via this module.

## Roadmap

Potential improvements:

* Publish module to PS Gallery for easier upkeep
